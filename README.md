### **COVID-19 CHANGED MY MUSIC TASTE**

After six months in lockdown and being one the privileged ones to experiment with new habits and lifestyles during the quarantine, I look back at my streaming history to identify the changes in my music tastes during the lockdown. During the process I identified the following:
* I listened to **964** artists during a period of 12 months, out of which I discovered **313** of them only after the lockdown.
* My top artists and tracks changed during the lockdown.
* During the lockdown, I streamed **BTS**'s music the most.

I further extended my analysis to dive deeper into BTS in an attempt to know what it was that changed my preferences drastically. During the process I identified that BTS's music has **high 'danceability' and energy**, which acted as a escape from the monotony of quarantine.

Lastly, I extracted some data of other [top K-Pop artists](https://www.koreaboo.com/lists/top-25-followed-kpop-artists-spotify/) to find similar tracks based on my preference of audio features.

### How I got the data
 1. [Spotify streaming history](https://github.com/Sniggdhaa/Me-Music-and-I/blob/master/my-spotify-data.ipynb) -- by Spotify 
 2. [BTS data](https://github.com/Sniggdhaa/Me-Music-and-I/blob/master/bangtan.ipynb) -- Spotify Web API
 3. [Top K-Pop artist and music data](https://github.com/Sniggdhaa/Me-Music-and-I/blob/master/k-pop-data.ipynb) -- Spotify Web API
